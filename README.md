# OptiGUI

A drop-in replacement for OptiFine custom GUIs.

This mod should support most OptiFine GUI resource packs. I didn't do an extensive test with the .properties files, because I couldn't find such a resource pack.
If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue.

This mod should work, but it's missing `texture.<path>` to replace any texture. It will be added soon.
It may get some optimizations in the next version alongside the previous feature.

This mod supports OptiFine custom GUIs, but not animations.
