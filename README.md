# OptiGUI

A drop-in replacement for OptiFine custom GUIs.

This mod supports most OptiFine GUI resource packs. I didn't do an extensive test with the .properties files, because I couldn't find such a resource pack.
If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue.

## How do I use it
1. Download ([Github releases](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI/releases) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/optigui) / [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optigui))
2. Put it in your mods folder
