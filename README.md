# OptiGUI

A client side drop-in replacement for OptiFine custom GUIs.

This mod supports most OptiFine GUI resource packs. I didn't do an extensive test with the .properties files, because I couldn't find such a resource pack.
If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue.

This list is not exhaustive. If you know a resource pack which works, please open an issue. If you know a resource pack which does not work, but works with OptiFine, please open an issue.

## Partially supported resource packs

* [Advanced GUI](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/custom-gui/) ยน

ยน Color shulker boxes, Ender chests and Villager Professions do not work. The resource pack does not include OptiFine-specific assets, and these features are not supported by OptiGUI. (Some mods (Colourful Containers) include assets for these features and work on OptiGUI)

## Incompatible mods

These mods are known to have issues with OptiGUI. Unless noted otherwise, these mods **can** be loaded alongside OptiGUI, but interfere with this mod's functionality.

* [Litematica Printer](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer) - print mode resets any open GUI texture. Reopening the GUI fixes the texture. [#15](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI/issues/15)

## Additions to OptiFine

This mod supports some additional GUIs which are not (yet) supported by OptiFine. These start with an underscore (`_`) to minimize the chance of an incompatibility with an upcoming OptiFine update.

### `container` additions:

* `container` accepts the following additional types: `_cartography_table, _grindstone, _loom, _smithing_table, _stonecutter` to replace the GUI of a cartography table, grindstone, loom, smithing table, or stonecutter, respectively.

### `container=chest` additions:

* `_barrel=<true|false>`: replace the GUI of a barrel.

### `container=furnace` additions:

* `variants` accepts the following values: `_furnace, _blast, _blast_furnace, _smoker` to replace the GUI of a furnace, blast furnace (2x), or smoker, respectively.

### `container=villager` additions:

* `professions` additionally accepts the value `_wandering_trader` to replace the GUI of a wandering trader.
