# OptiGUI

A drop-in replacement for OptiFine custom GUIs.

This mod should support most OptiFine GUI resource packs. I didn't do an extensive test with the .properties files, because I couldn't find such a resource pack.
If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue.

This mod should work. It may get some optimizations in the next version.

This mod supports OptiFine custom GUIs, but not animations.
